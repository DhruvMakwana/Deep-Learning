## Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### [Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

This is my personal projects for the course. The course covers deep learning from begginer level to advanced. Through five
interconnected courses, this develop a profound knowledge of the hottest AI algorithms, mastering deep learning from its foundations (neural networks) to its industry applications (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, etc.).
